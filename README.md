This is my senior project for my final semester as a Data Science undergraduate student at the University of Houston - Downtown
. This project applies machine learning methods in Python (with use of scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib and various other packages) to predict whether a song is going to be popular or not using the Billboard Top 100 as popularity reference. The variables used for prediction are characteristics provided by Spotify which are acquired from using the spotipy package in Python.
