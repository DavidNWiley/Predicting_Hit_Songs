This is project for my final semester as a Data Science undergraduate student at the University of Houston - Downtown. This project applies machine learning methods in Python (with use of `sklearn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and various other packages) to predict whether a song is going to be popular or not. I will be utilizing the Billboard Top 100 as popularity reference. The variables used for prediction are characteristics provided by Spotify which are acquired from using the `spotipy` package in Python.
